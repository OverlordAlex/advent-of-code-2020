# Advent of Code
This is my attempt to solve as many problems from the 2020 AoC in as many languages as possible, as a form of advanced "Hello World!"

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Each program is self-contained. The language chosen, the presumed website, and some thoughts on the language are included below.

## P1: Souffle [https://souffle-lang.github.io/]
        Some unnecessary processing going on here.
        Definitely don't know enough about logic or Souffle to tighten it up
---

## P2: Python 2.7 [https://www.python.org/]
        Wrote this while tired, not sure why the ^ works here


## P3: Nim [https://nim-lang.org/]
        Pythonish with compiled speed? So far really liking it
        Run with `nim -c --run`.
---

## P4: Bash [https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/]
        Good ol' ugly bash.
        Something wrong in the regex, but it passed all my tests
---

## P5: F# [https://fsharp.org/]
        Functional, but at what cost?
        So many bad practices here, but F# is still my favourite functional lang
---
 
## P6: Javascript [?? https://www.javascript.com/]
        Not bad, but incredibly inconsistent function names (eg length, vs size)
        Unhelpful error messages most of the time

# P7:
