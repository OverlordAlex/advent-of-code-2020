P1:
    Souffle
        Some unnecessary processing going on here.
        Definitely don't know enough about logic or Souffle to tighten it up

P2:
    Python 2.7
        Wrote this while tired, not sure why the ^ works here
    https://www.python.org/

P3:
    Nim
        Pythonish with compiled speed? So far really liking it
        Run with `nim -c --run`.

P4:
    Bash
        Good ol' ugly bash.
        Something wrong in the regex, but it passed all my tests
    https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/

P5
    F#
        Functional, but at what cost?
        So many bad practices here, but F# is still my favourite functional lang

P6
    Javascript
        Not bad, but incredibly inconsistent function names (eg length, vs size)
        Unhelpful error messages most of the time
